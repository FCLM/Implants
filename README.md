The two crafter scripts will craft using the first implants in the slot. In the event you are leftover with a non-multiple of 5, simply craft the leftovers manually so that the next stack is in the first slot.

Crafters for T3 and T4 can be created, but have effectively 0 time savings as the amount of T3's and T4's are a manageable amount.
